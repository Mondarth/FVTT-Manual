Sheet
=====

Some windows that Foundry presents have a Sheet associated with them (most notably the :doc:`/player/ui/character-sheet`. The Sheet is the 'template' used to present the UI window and sometimes it can be changed to present the window in a different configuration.

Choosing different sheets
-------------------------

There may be more than one Sheet available for a UI window. You can check using the Sheet configuration button (top right of the character sheet---if this button is not present, the window has no Sheet configuration).

.. todo:: Add Sheet icon

If the :guilabel:`This Sheet` drop-down has more than one entry, try selecting another option, then :guilabel:`Save Sheet Configuration`. The character sheet will be redrawn using the new Sheet. If you don't like the new layout simply repeat this process selecting another option.

To reset back to the original layout select :guilabel:`Default Sheet`.
