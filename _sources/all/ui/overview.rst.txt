Foundry's User Interface
========================

Different users will experience slightly different Foundry interfaces (see the :doc:`Player </player/ui/overview>`, :doc:`Game Master </gm/ui/overview>`, and :doc:`Administrator </admin/ui/overview>` for details). Your user interface may also appear differently depending upon what game system you play and what enhancements your Game Master has enabled.

Foundry is highly customizable. This customizablilty extends to the user interface (UI) meaning that your specific in-game experience `may` (in fact most likely `will`) vary from what this manual describes. That said, most games will preserve the basic UI layout, and it is this we will describe.
