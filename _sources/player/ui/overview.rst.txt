Foundry's User Interface - Players
==================================

As a player your experience is focussed on viewing scenes presented by your Game Master (GM) and controlling your character (often represented by a token on the scene).

This section presents the core interface elements you will need as a player [#f1]_.


.. [#f1] This manual contains examples using the Dungeons & Dragons 5e system. Your experience may be different if using another game system or if your GM is using modules to enhance your experience.
