Character Sheet
===============

The quickest way to access your character's details (character sheet) is by pressing :kbd:`C` on the keyboard. This will open your primary character sheet [#f1]_.

The details for any character you can view can be opened by a |LMB| on the actor in the :guilabel:`Actors` tab [#f2]_.

---------------------------------

There may be more than one :doc:`/all/concepts/sheet` available for character sheets. You can check using the :ref:`sheet monfiguration button <sheet configuration button>` (top right of the character sheet).

.. [#f1] While most players will control a single character you may find yourself running more than one (for example, a magic user may have a familiar that the |GM| has provided as a controllable actor). When this happens the :kbd:`C` opens the primary character's sheet (set in :doc:`config/player-dialog`).

.. [#f2] You need to |LMB| on the text (the mouse cursor changes to the |mc-hand|), otherwise nothing will happen.
