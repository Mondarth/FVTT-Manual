.. _player logon:

Joining a Game
==============

Players will log on to running games. The |GM| will have started the game world and sent you an invitation link. Use this invitation link to connect to the running game. You will see a login screen similar to this:

.. todo:: Login screen

.. todo:: Add icons for Select User and User Password fields (see https://documatt.com/restructuredtext-reference/element/inline-image.html)
Select your player name (also supplied by your |GM|) from the :guilabel:`Select User` dropdown and enter any :guilabel:`User Password`. Click the :guilabel:`JOIN GAME SESSION` button to connect to the game.

It may take a few seconds to load the Foundry game interface. How long this takes will depend on many factors, such as:

- The speed of your internet connection to the Foundry server.
- The capabilities of your computer and browser.
- How your |GM| has configured the game.
  - The more modules they enable, the slower the game will load.
  - The more detailed the :ref:`Scene <scene>` you enter on.

If this is the first time you are connecting you may see a :ref:`User Configuration dialog <player configuration dialog>`. This allows you to set some initial configuration (these can be :ref:`changed at any time <player config dialog changes>`).
