Player Settings
===============

Once you are familiar with Foundry's interface you may want to 'tweak' things to suit your preferences. There are two main ways you can customise your Foundry experience, both accessed through the :guilabel:`Game Settings` tab:

- :guilabel:`Configure Settings` provides access to all in-game settings available to you.

  Precisely which settings are available will depend on what modules your |GM| has activated in the game.

- :guilabel:`Configure Controls` allows you to change keybindings (shortcut keys) and mouse controls.
