   User Configuration Dialog

:guilabel:`Player Name`
  This is provided by the |GM|. If you need this changed, speak to them.

.. _UCD player avatar field:
:guilabel:`Player Avatar`
  If you are using the |FVTT| :ref:`Audio/Video chat <player av chat>`, this image will be presented as your avatar. The image must exist on the Foundry server. Your GM will be able to advise on where suitable avatars exist.

  The player avatar represents `you` (the player) rather than any character you play in the game.

  This avatar may also be used by modules used to customise Foundry.

.. _UCD player color field:
:guilabel:`Player Color`
  This is the color used to highlight elements specific to you. In the default interface this color is used for the player name in the :doc:`/all/ui/players`.


  You can either enter a color code directly in the text entry box or (more usefully for most players) use the color picker (accessed by left-clicking the color swatch to the right of the text entry box).

:guilabel:`Player Pronouns`
  If you have preferred pronouns (or the table have jsked for these to be provided) then you can enter them in this text box, e.g. 'She/Her', 'They/Them'. These are then displayed in the :doc:`/all/ui/players`.

.. _player config player character:
:guilabel:`Player Character`
  You can select one :ref:`Actor <Actor>` to represent you.

  It is possible you have access to multiple Actors within the game (for example you may have a main character and a companion creature). This selection idetifies you 'main' character.

Once you mave set things to your satisfaction, use the :guilabel:`Save Player Configuration` button to commit them to Foundry.
