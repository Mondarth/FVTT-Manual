Installing a Game World
=======================

We discuss here two apporaches:

1. Installing a game world.
2. Installing an adventure into an existing world.

Why two? The second, installing an adventure into an existing world, is by far the more common approach these days but the first method is still available in |FVTT|.

Before embarking on this discussion we need to clarify some terminology:

Game World
  The collection of data that represents 
Session
  The periond in which a group plays.
Session Wolrd
  The idea of a game world being used and reused by a group over multiple sessions to play mutiple adventures.
Adventure
  A scenario played out by the group.
Campaign
  Typically longer than an adventure, often consisting of many adventures that the |gm| has integrated into the groups ongoing narrative.

Installing an adventure
-----------------------

This approach is preferred because it allows an adventure (or whole campaign) to be added to an existing :term:`game world`. The game world is treated as 'my groups ongoing session space' and whatever new adventure the |gm| want to add to the groups playing options can be added on to that ongoing 'session world'. If you were forced to install a game world (rather than adding to an existing world) you would the have to migrate things like player characters, novel items, rules, etc. from the previous world into this new world. It makes more sense for adventure/campaign builders to provide them as modules that can be added to any world rather than forcing everyone to effectively start over on every adventure.
