Key Concepts
============

As a :ref:`Player <player>` you can expect your |GM| to walk you through their Foundry setup so that they can check:

- Your setup (computer, browser, etc.) can support the game.
- You are comfortable with the basic operation of the game.

.. caution:: If your GM `does not` take time before the first session to introduce you to their game setup it may be a bad sign for the rest of the game.

   That said, some GM's will take everyone in the group through the introduction at the start of the first session.

This said, it is best if you are familiar with some basic concepts. For players I recommend you understand at least :doc:`concepts/game`, :doc:`concepts/actor`, and :doc:`concepts/token`

Additionally, familiarise yourself wih the :doc:`/player/ui/overview`

If you are a :ref:`Game Master <game master>`, you really need a good grasp on all the key concepts in this section.
