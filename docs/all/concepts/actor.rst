Actor
=====

An Actor contains all the data associated with some agent within the :doc:`game`. This agent could be an player character (PC), a Non-player Character (NPC), or anything else that needs to be tracked in the game. (PC's and NPC's are by far the most common actor types).

If you are a :ref:`player <player>` then your character is represented by an actor. In most game systems you view your character's detais using a :doc:`character sheet </player/ui/character-sheet>`.
