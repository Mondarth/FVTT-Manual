.. todo:: Actions

Things happens when action is taken. This might be an character operating a switch, pulling a rope, opening a door, picking a lock, or attacking an enemy (or friend---you know who you are).

The 'actor' is usually a :doc:`token` on the current scene and the thing(s) acted upon may be identified by proximity (`n` feet from the actor), by :doc:`targeting`, or the :term:`player` interacts with it directly (|LMB|, |RMB|, etc.).
