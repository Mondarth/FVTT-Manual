Logging on
==========

Logging on to Foundry is a slightly different experience depending on:

1. Whether you are an Administator or a Player/Game Master.
2. How your Foundry server is hosted and configured [#f1]_.


Role differences
----------------

:ref:`administrator` do not 'log on' in the same way players and game masters log on to a :doc:`game world <../concepts/world>`. Instead anyone trying to access the :doc:`setup` will be challenged for the :guilabel:`Administator Password`, which is set when the server is installed (it can be subsequently changed via the :doc:`setup/application_configuration` dialog).

When a :doc:`game world <../concepts/world>` is running players and game masters can log on to that game world through the :doc:`join`.
