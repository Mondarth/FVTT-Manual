Game Masters Start Here
=======================

Foundry can be a bit daunting to new users. I first used it as a :term:`player` and, although I had taken the time to install my own copy of |FVTT| and investigate the basics of playing with it, my first game was slow and (at times) confusing. My |gm| was great (very paient) but I could not help feeling that my playing experience would be better if I was more comfortable with the Foundry interface. As a Game Master it is `very` easy to get lost in the wilderness. There is so much depth to Foundry that it is easy to be distracted from the primary mission, 'provide players with an excellent game experience'. This section aims to guide new |gm|\ s through the process of first running, then building games using the core Foundry Tools\ [#F1]_.

Foundry has a reasonable set of documentation (it is a bit out of date in places---as of Feb'25) but another perspective could not hurt... So here it is. This is the manual I wish I had when I started out.

This section is an tutorial/walkthrough for Game Masters. :doc:`/all/ui/overview` contains a comprehensive reference document to which we refer often.


Where to begin?
---------------

You will need access to a Foundry VTT server with a :term:`game world`. There are several ways you can get to this point, each requiring an :term:`administrator` (this may well be you and if so I suggest you step on over to :doc:`/administrator`). For the purposes of this walkthrough I assume you (or the |FVTT| administrator) has set up a :term:`game world` (we look at the bigger topic of building a game world in :doc:`/gm/developing/overview`), specifically I assume you have the game world :doc:`'Mondarth Tutorial Sandbox' installed </tutorial/mondarth/sandbox/install>`\ [#F2]_.


.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#F1] It is often necessary to add this 'core Foundry VTT' caveat because |FVTT| is expandable using a module system and many of these change the way you approach running and developing in Foundry.
.. [#F2] Although it is not essential to have this game world installed the tutorial will be easier to follow with it.
