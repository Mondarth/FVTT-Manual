Administrators Start Here
=========================

The Foundry administrator is responsible for maintaining the Foundry server. This could mean :doc:`installing the Foundry software </admin/install>` and keeping it :doc:`updated </admin/updating>`, or you may be using one of the hosted Foundry services (in which case the specific details for obtaining, installing, and updating :term:`game systems <Game System>` and :term:`modules <Module>` will likely be different, refer to your provider's instructions). This section assumes you are administering your own Foundry VTT server (self hosting).
